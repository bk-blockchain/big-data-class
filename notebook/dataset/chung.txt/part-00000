Examples for Learning Spark
===============
Examples for the Learning Spark book. These examples require a number of libraries and as such have long build files. We have also added a stand alone example with minimal dependencies and a small build file
in the mini-complete-example directory.


These examples have been updated to run against Spark 1.3 so they may
be slightly different than the versions in your copy of "Learning Spark".

Requirements
==
* JDK 1.7 or higher
* Scala 2.10.3
- scala-lang.org
* Spark 1.3
* Protobuf compiler
- On debian you can install with sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
* R & the CRAN package Imap are required for the ChapterSixExample
